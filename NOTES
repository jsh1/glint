Issues
======

5. Can't change document size.

6. -group: should inherit geometry from single object.

  If one object, copy bounds and transform into group, and reset object.

  If multiple objects, take bounding rect from common parent.

7. Add transition editing view

  Header has two popup buttons: from and to states, with "Any". Outline
  view of all objects (layers) that have state changes between the two
  selected states, expanding the object shows the properties that the
  state modifies. Simple timeline on right hand side (begin, duration,
  function).

  Or an alternate method:

  Combine state chooser and transition editor into a single horizontal
  panel: narrow table view on each side listing all states (and
  Any/Super), and wider middle outline view with the layers and
  properties that change between the two states, and their timeline.
  Selecting a state on either side switches to that state and moves the
  time scrubber all the way to the left or right, so that the picked
  state is visible. Dragging the time scrubber then plays through the
  transition.

  When a state is selected in left/right it's grayed out of the other
  view, and states representing explicitly-defined transitions are
  highlighted somehow (bold?)

8. Finish inspector

  - Color picker needs popover with pickable color image.
  - Context sensitive number formatting.
  - Number control scrubbing.
  - Image controls.

9. Support fake-spring timing in transitions.

10. Inspector should be unnecessary for 80% of operations.

  - selected rect layers should have onscreen controls for colors, line
    width, etc (they already have corner radius)

  - similar for path layers (once, of course, path editing is done)

  - image layers should have an onscreen button (?) to select image

11. Add edge snapping while dragging.

12. Add keyboard controls to canvas.

  - cursor keys move objects.

13. Show thumbnails.

  - Layers panel.
  - States panel. [done]
  - Inspected object.
