Issues
======

1. Should content nodes have geometry?

  I.e should they be subclasses of MgLayerNode instead of
  MgDrawableNode? I'm conflicted about this, but will keep the current
  scheme for now.

2. Should content nodes have alpha and blendMode properties?

  The simplest method would be push the properties up to
  MgDrawableNode, but it means they'd also exist on MgTimelineNode,
  which doesn't make much sense.

  Currently they use the blend mode of their layer, unless layer.group
  is true, in which case the layer's content will be sover'd and then
  composited using the layer's blend mode.

3. Remove masksToBounds property from MgLayerNode?

  Exactly the same effect can be had by setting layer.mask to an
  instance of MgRectNode. So in the interests of eliminating redundancy
  masksToBounds should be eliminated.

  RESOLVED: deleted.
